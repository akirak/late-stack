This article was primarily generated by an AI for the purpose of demonstrating the content styling and formatting features of this website. The content is for illustrative purposes only.

Welcome! This page is a guide to the different visual styles used on this blog. Specific formatting is used to make articles clear, easy to read, and engaging. Here‚Äôs what it all means.

## Basic Text Formatting

To help guide readers through articles, standard text styles are used for emphasis.

- **Bold text** is used for strong emphasis.
- _Italic text_ is used for gentle emphasis or to highlight certain terms.
- Text that is ~~struck out~~ indicates something that is no longer relevant.

### Lists

Lists are used to organize information. They can be bulleted or numbered.

**Bulleted List:**

- An item of interest.
- Another related item.
  - A sub-item with more detail.

**Numbered List:**

1. The first step in a process.
2. The second step.
3. The final step.

### Links

Links to other pages look like this: [An example link to the About page](/about). Text styled this way can be clicked to navigate to another page or an external website.

### Quotes

When a person or source is quoted, the text is displayed in a distinct block like this:

> This is a quote. It stands out from the regular text to show that it's a direct quotation from another source.

## Special Content Blocks

To make content more dynamic and helpful, a variety of special blocks are used to highlight information.

### Callout Boxes

These boxes draw attention to specific types of information. Each color and title has a different purpose.

:::info
This is an **Info** box. It provides additional, nice-to-know information that supplements the main text.
:::

:::warning
This is a **Warning** box. It alerts readers to potential risks or advises caution.
:::

:::error
This is an **Error** box. It indicates something that is incorrect or will cause a problem.
:::

Besides the basic callout box types illustrated above, there can be variants with custom emojis and titles.

:::info[Favorite: Key takeaway for the reader]{emoji="‚≠ê"}
Use this to call out **key points** or takeaways.
:::

:::info[Tip: A helpful piece of advice]{emoji="üí°"}
Provide a **helpful suggestion** or a shortcut here.
:::

:::info[Reminder: Don't forget this]{emoji="üìå"}
A gentle nudge about something **important to remember**.
:::

:::error[Fatal error: A critical warning]{emoji="üí•"}
This signifies a **critical issue** that needs immediate attention.
:::

### Embedded Content

Sometimes content from other websites is embedded directly in an article.

**Webpage Preview:**
A preview of another webpage may be displayed, which can be clicked to visit the page.

**YouTube Video:**
Videos may also be embedded, which can be played directly on the page.

### Tables

Tables are used to present structured information in a clear and organized way.

| Category        | Status | Description                             |
| --------------- | :----: | --------------------------------------- |
| Text Formatting |   ‚úÖ   | Used for emphasis and clarity.          |

## For Technical Articles

In more technical posts, specialized formatting is used for code and diagrams.

### Code Blocks

Code examples are presented in formatted blocks with syntax highlighting to make them easy to read.

```javascript
// This is what a JavaScript code block looks like.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}
```

Some code blocks may have a title. They might also be partially collapsed, with a button to expand the hidden lines, which is useful for focusing on the most important parts of a long example.

```python collapse={2-4} title="Python example"
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))
```

Other times, the differences between two pieces of code may be shown. Lines with a `+` and a green background have been added, while lines with a `-` and a red background have been removed.

```diff lang="bash"
# Shell commands
-npm install
-npm run dev
+pnpm install
+pnpm run dev
```

### Diagrams

Diagrams may also be used to illustrate concepts and workflows.

:::diagram{.fit}

```d2
# This is an example of a diagram.
direction: right

Concept_A -> Is_Connected_To -> Concept_B
```

## Site-Wide Features

### Light and Dark Themes

You can switch between light and dark themes using the button in the top-right
corner.

By default, the theme matches your system's settings. When you manually select a
theme, that choice is saved and overrides the system setting. To restore the
automatic theme selection, you need to clear this website's cookies in your
