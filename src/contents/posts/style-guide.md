Welcome! This page is a guide to the different visual styles used on this blog. Specific formatting is used to make articles clear, easy to read, and engaging. Here’s what it all means.

## Basic Text Formatting

To help guide readers through articles, standard text styles are used for emphasis.

- **Bold text** is used for strong emphasis.
- _Italic text_ is used for gentle emphasis or to highlight certain terms.
- Text that is ~~struck out~~ indicates something that is no longer relevant.

### Lists

Lists are used to organize information. They can be bulleted or numbered.

**Bulleted List:**

- An item of interest.
- Another related item.
  - A sub-item with more detail.

**Numbered List:**

1. The first step in a process.
2. The second step.
3. The final step.

### Links

Links to other pages look like this: [An example link to the About page](/about). Text styled this way can be clicked to navigate to another page or an external website.

### Quotes

When a person or source is quoted, the text is displayed in a distinct block like this:

> This is a quote. It stands out from the regular text to show that it's a direct quotation from another source.

## Special Content Blocks

To make content more dynamic and helpful, a variety of special blocks are used to highlight information.

### Callout Boxes

These boxes draw attention to specific types of information. Each color and title has a different purpose.

:::tip
This is a **Tip** box. It offers helpful advice or a useful shortcut.
:::

:::info
This is an **Info** box. It provides additional, nice-to-know information that supplements the main text.
:::

:::important
This is an **Important** box. It contains key information that should not be missed.
:::

:::warning
This is a **Warning** box. It alerts readers to potential risks or advises caution.
:::

:::error
This is an **Error** box. It indicates something that is incorrect or will cause a problem.
:::

### Embedded Content

Sometimes content from other websites is embedded directly in an article.

**Webpage Preview:**
A preview of another webpage may be displayed, which can be clicked to visit the page.

**YouTube Video:**
Videos may also be embedded, which can be played directly on the page.

### Tables

Tables are used to present structured information in a clear and organized way.

| Category        | Status | Description                             |
| --------------- | :----: | --------------------------------------- |
| Text Formatting |   ✅   | Used for emphasis and clarity.          |
| Lists           |   ✅   | Used to organize information.           |
| Links & Images  |   ✅   | Used to provide navigation and visuals. |
| Callout Boxes   |   ✅   | Used to highlight important messages.   |

### Footnotes

A small, clickable number may appear after a sentence, like this.[^1] These are footnotes. Clicking on one will take the reader to a note at the bottom of the page that provides extra information, a citation, or a comment.

[^1]: This is an example of a footnote.

## For Technical Articles

In more technical posts, specialized formatting is used for code and diagrams.

### Code Blocks

Code examples are presented in formatted blocks with syntax highlighting to make them easy to read.

```javascript
// This is what a JavaScript code block looks like.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}
```

Some code blocks may have a title. They might also be partially collapsed, with a button to expand the hidden lines, which is useful for focusing on the most important parts of a long example.

```python collapse={2-4} title="Python example"
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))
```

Other times, the differences between two pieces of code may be shown. Lines with a `+` and a green background have been added, while lines with a `-` and a red background have been removed.

```diff lang="bash"
# Shell commands
-npm install
-npm run dev
+pnpm install
+pnpm run dev
```

### Diagrams

Diagrams may also be used to illustrate concepts and workflows.

:::diagram

```d2
// This is an example of a diagram.
Concept_A -> Is_Connected_To -> Concept_B
```
